📘 Laravel Pizzahouse A Laravel-powered simple Pizza ordering website. This is only a pet project to test my capabalities in creating websites using Laravel. Mainly inspired by Net Ninja's Pizzahouse Laravel series in youtube​, but with added email notifications both client and server side as well as price calculations.

* Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory  
  (Use `git clone <repository-url>` and `cd <project-folder>` to get started)

* Install PHP dependencies using Composer  
  (Make sure Composer is installed, then run `composer install`)

* Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`  
  (This sets up your environment configuration file)

* Generate the application key  
  (Run `php artisan key:generate` to secure your app)

* Configure the `.env` file with your database and environment settings  
  (Update `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and other relevant values.  
  Also configure mail settings with your own mailer service provider — preferably Gmail SMTP)

* Run database migrations and seeders  
  (Execute `php artisan migrate`. You can also use the seeders available)

* Install Node dependencies and compile frontend assets  
  (Run `npm install` and then `npm run dev` to build JS/CSS assets)

* Serve the application using Artisan  
  (Start the local server with `php artisan serve`. Don’t forget to run `npm run dev` again if you make changes)

* Access the application at `http://localhost:8000`  
  (Open in your browser to view the Laravel project)
